[Milestone Log – 2025-04-13]

▶ Milestone: DOM Capture and Override Sanity Test
▶ Trigger: Post-publish screenshot prep (LinkedIn tab left open)
▶ Environment: Chrome persistent session, single open tab (LinkedIn)
▶ Behavior Observed:
    - Aurora attempted browser launch
    - Browser opened to last-used tab (LinkedIn)
    - Aurora issued new navigation request to ChatGPT
    - Waited for page readiness (confirmed via presence of chip: “Create image”)
    - DOM captured (length: 213,443 characters)
    - Session closed successfully
    - Reflex agent declared test PASSED

▶ Notes:
    - DOM size reflects full page render including sidebar, headers, history, and async content
    - ElementMapper routines remain performant
    - Parser may benefit from scoped extraction zones in future branches

▶ Milestone: Reflexive Prompt Injection + DOM Reply Capture
▶ Trigger: Manual test of intelligent browser-based interaction loop
▶ Environment: Chrome persistent profile session (ChatGPT UI loaded directly)
▶ Behavior Observed:
    - Prompt text injected into ChatGPT’s ProseMirror input field
    - Submission triggered via .send_keys(Keys.ENTER)
    - DOM monitored for stable assistant message completion using fade-aware polling
    - Parser reinitialized post-render with updated HTML snapshot
    - Successfully extracted and printed four AI-generated response bubbles

▶ Output Sample:
    [Bubble 1]: Got it! Session is now officially named:
    [Bubble 2]: AUTO_TEST “Aurora says hello… and she brought her own clipboard.”
    [Bubble 3]: Let’s mark it as an active exploratory session...
    [Bubble 4]: Let me know what you’d like AUTO_TEST to focus on first...

▶ Notes:
    - Response text arrived with staggered fade-ins; required stability-aware DOM polling
    - No API used; all interaction occurred through the GUI layer
    - System is now capable of sending and interpreting full AI responses in real-time
    - Branch T01-B03_HTML_GPT_INTERFACE remains open for reflex queue integration

▶ Milestone: Reflex Loop #12 – Format-Agnostic Code Capture
▶ Trigger: Prompt #12 initiated via test_submit_prompt_demo.py
▶ Environment: GUI-driven test harness, no API access
▶ Behavior Observed:
    - SessionDriver launched Chrome (non-headless)
    - ChatGPT GUI loaded, prompt injected directly into interface
    - Prompt composed by ChatGPT itself (self-reflexive)
    - DOM monitored until message stability achieved
    - Parser extracted 8 response bubbles and 2 classic <pre><code> blocks
    - Code was well-formed, multi-function, and shell-executable
    - Session closed with no errors

▶ Output Sample:
    [Code Block 1]: YAML config validator in full Python3 format with CLI, argparse, and usage instructions

▶ Notes:
    - Format fallback (Monaco support) was present but not triggered in this run
    - Prompt self-generation confirmed as viable for autonomous session bootstrapping
    - This test completes the reflex round-trip: prompt → submission → capture → synthesis
    - Officially designates the test loop as Format-Agnostic Reflex Capture (FARC-capable)

[Public Response Log – 2025-04-14]

▶ Milestone: Reflex Demo Video – LinkedIn Impressions Surge
▶ Trigger: Posting of live browser automation demo showcasing Aurora's reflex integration
▶ Outcome:
    - Post gained 1,501 impressions within 16 hours
    - 57.7% increase in member reach compared to prior 7 days
    - Chart spike confirms Aurora demo as top-performing content (April 8–14)
▶ Insights:
    - Demo video successfully demonstrated real-time AI prompt injection, DOM response capture
    - Viewer interest peaked after period of low engagement
    - Confirms narrative + visual proof pairing is highly effective for outreach

▶ Milestone: Aurora GUI – Sequencer list and step list population successful
▶ Trigger: Clicking the "ARM" button enables "EDIT" only if no assigned steps, plus "RUN" if they are.
▶ Environment: GUI-driven test harness, no API access
▶ Behavior Observed:
    - GUI launches with Aurora fade-in splash
    - "Sequences tab" displays available sequences
    - "Prompt composed by ChatGPT itself (self-reflexive)
    - "Steps" listbox populates with assigned steps per selected sequence
    - Clicking "ARM" on a selected sequence with no steps enables only the "EDIT" button
    - Clicking "ARM" on a selected sequence with assigned steps enables the "RUN" and "EDIT" buttons
    - Clicking "RUN" launches the browser then attempts to inject garbage code
    - A "prompt simulation utility" will be built to iron-out Aurora prompt composition

[Milestone Log – 2025-04-19]

▶ Milestone: Aurora Prompt Cycle Simulator operational with reflex resolution
▶ Trigger: Sequence selected and armed in GUI, then utility launched via menu
▶ Environment: PromptSimulatorWindow (no browser or API), simulated dispatcher mode
▶ Behavior Observed:
    - Menu item only enabled after a sequence is armed
    - PromptSimulatorWindow launches in single instance
    - Sequence runs in background thread; GUI updated using QMetaObject.invokeMethod
    - Reflex action 163 resolved via keys table to symbolic command "LAUNCH BROWSER"
    - Dispatcher translates symbolic command to "PROMPT: [Simulated browser launch triggered.]"
    - Prompt injected safely via cross-thread GUI update
    - GUI displays prompt; user types a simulated reply
    - Reply dequeued and logged, sequencer continues without crash
    - Status label updates from "Running..." to "Sequence complete."
    - Infinite jump loop detection triggers on malformed data
▶ Notes:
    - FLAT files T02 and T03 updated with module path corrections
    - dispatcher now handles symbolic command translation post-reflex resolution
    - Simulator serves as full-cycle test harness for sequencer logic

[Milestone Log – 2025-04-20]

▶ Milestone: Reflex dispatcher integration with sequencer
▶ Trigger: Sequence step lacks command, but contains reflex_action key
▶ Environment: SequenceController and SimulatedDispatcher using fallback logic
▶ Behavior Observed:
    - SequenceController passes step to dispatcher
    - Dispatcher detects missing command and attempts reflex lookup
    - resolve_reflex_action pulls mapped key string from keys table
    - Dispatcher uses resolved key string as command input
    - Jump loop protection halts infinite retries
    - Steps recorded in history log
▶ Notes:
    - dispatcher fallback logic complete
    - reflex resolution centralized in db_interface.py
    - FLAT path corrections made; file registered in T02_INITIAL_PROCESSING

[Milestone Log – 2025-04-20]

▶ Milestone: Prompt injection cross-thread fix + status update integration
▶ Trigger: Simulated prompt injection causes crash due to improper signal invocation
▶ Environment: PromptSimulatorWindow + SimulatedDispatcher running on threaded SequenceRunner
▶ Behavior Observed:
 - Sequence executed from GUI via background thread
 - Reflex command “LAUNCH BROWSER” resolved to symbolic command
 - Attempted GUI update triggered crash due to improper QMetaObject.invokeMethod usage
 - Resolved via use of Q_ARG(str, prompt_text) for thread-safe slot invocation
 - Prompt now reliably appears in simulator prompt view
 - User enters a reply, response is dequeued and logged
 - GUI status label updates upon sequence completion

▶ Notes:
 - Crash root cause: incorrect argument types passed to QMetaObject.invokeMethod
 - Fix applied within simulated_dispatcher.py using Q_ARG with Qt.QueuedConnection
 - Status updates via on_sequence_complete() verified
 - Milestone confirms full-thread safety in prompt simulation sequence mode
