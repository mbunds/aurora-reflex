#   - TEMPLATE: SSE COMMANDS - SSE SESSION LAUNCH AND CONCLUSIONS TEMPLATE [TBD]
# === BEGIN BASE TRUNK

This is SSE session T##_[FOCUS]

This trunk is intended as a planning and architectural node — not for code generation.

It inherits structural context from:

        ○ TXX_[PREVIOUS] (if applicable)
	○ FLAT files: [List relevant FLAT indexes if important here]

This session is scoped to:

        ○ [Module or subsystem under design]
	○ [Goal: plan, outline, resolve constraints, compare strategies]

Code generation is suppressed in this trunk.

Branches will be created for experiments, variants, or finalized implementation logic.

Updates will be reported upward and summarized into FLAT upon resolution.



# === BEGIN PARALLEL BASE TRUNK

This is SSE session T##_[FOCUS]_[SUBTRUNK]

This trunk is intended as an extension from T##_[FOCUS], a more general planning base trunk, this one being more focused on planning and architecture refinement — not for code generation.

It inherits structural context from sessions and files from:

    ○ T##_[PARENT] (base trunk session of same namespace)
    ○ FLAT files: [List inherited FLAT indexes or relevant structural notes]

This session is scoped to:

    ○ [Subsystem logic, orchestration layer, or complex feature breakout]
    ○ [Refining high-level design from TRUNK##_PARENT into modular planning]

This session exists as a parallel trunk under the same root and does not represent a forked vision.
Instead, it narrows scope from the general trunk and supports modular clarity.

Code generation is suppressed in this trunk.

Branches will be created for:

    ○ Specific subsystems
    ○ Experiments
    ○ or Implementations requiring isolation from broader planning logs

Updates will be reported upward to TRUNK##_PARENT and summarized into FLAT upon resolution.



# === BEGIN BRANCH

This is SSE session T##-B##_[TASK FOCUS]_[MODIFIER]

This branch is spawned from T##_[PARENT] and inherits its structure, goals, and architectural assumptions.

This session will perform:

        ○ [Design testing / Implementation / Variant exploration / Refactoring]
	○ Based on context from: [Reference files or prior branches]

FLAT files presumed relevant:

        ○ FLAT_FILE_A.txt
	○ FLAT_FILE_B.txt

Output may include:

        ○ [Draft modules, FLAT registry entries, test harness stubs, structural notes]

Upon conclusion, this branch will report status and decisions to its trunk.

If concluded, it may be renamed with a LEAF## prefix for archival clarity.

# === (IF this branch has branches, declare its trunk status):

This is SSE session T##-B##_[MODULE_NAME]TASK FOCUS]_[MODIFIER]
It is named as T##[+1]_[FOCUS] and is host to the following branches:
T##-B01_[MODULE_NAME]TASK FOCUS]_[MODIFIER]
T##-B02_[MODULE_NAME]TASK FOCUS]_[MODIFIER]
T##-B[02]NNN]_[MODULE_NAME]TASK FOCUS]_[MODIFIER]
…

This trunk is intended as a planning and architectural node AND for code generation.

It inherits structural context from:

○ TXX_[PREVIOUS] (if applicable)
○ FLAT files: [List relevant FLAT indexes if important here]

This session is scoped to:

○ [Module or subsystem under design]
○ [Goal: plan, outline, resolve constraints, compare strategies]

Code generation is not suppressed in this trunk.

Branches will be created for experiments, variants, or finalized implementation logic.

Updates will be reported upward and summarized into FLAT upon resolution.



# === CONCLUDE BRANCH

This session is now concluded, to be designated from T##-B##_[TASK FOCUS]_[MODIFIER] to T##-L##_[TASK FOCUS]_[MODIFIER]

This session has reached a terminal state due to:

        ○ [Completion of module]
	○ [Experiment deemed non-viable or shelved for future]
	○ [Planning snapshot preserved]

Final outputs include:

        ○ [Summarize what was achieved: modules, conclusions, errors, etc.]

All relevant findings will be passed upstream and downstream to:

        ○ B##_[PARENT]
	○ T##_[ROOT]

This session is now frozen and marked for archival, cross-reference, or future inspiration.



# === CONCLUDE TRUNK

This session is now concluded, to be designated from T##_[TRUNK DETAILS] to concluded after processing this prompt.

This session has reached a terminal state due to:

        ○ [Completion of module]
	○ [Experiment deemed non-viable or shelved for future]
	○ [Planning snapshot preserved]

Final outputs include:

        ○ [Summarize what was achieved: modules, conclusions, errors, etc.]

All relevant findings will be passed upstream and downstream to:

        ○ T##_[PARALLEL TRUNK IF ANY]
	○ T##_[NEXT]

This session is now frozen and marked for archival, cross-reference, or future inspiration.
