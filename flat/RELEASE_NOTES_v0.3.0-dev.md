# Aurora Reflex System – Version 0.3.0-dev

This release marks the first structured milestone in the development of *Aurora* — a reflexive AI control system engineered for autonomous session orchestration, FLAT-based prompt tracking, and GUI-driven interaction with AI models.

---

## ✨ Highlights

- **Structured Session Engineering (SSE):**  
  Modular architecture established for managing session flow, logic isolation, and reflex sequences.

- **FLAT File Integration:**  
  Complete adoption of the File-based Logic Assembly Tree system for deterministic prompt association, module referencing, and reproducible context control.

- **Reflex Architecture Online:**  
  Browser-based DOM control and prompt injection working in live ChatGPT environments. Session drivers initialized. Code extraction stable via `innerText`.

- **GUI & Sequencer:**  
  Qt-based control panel with interrupt queue display, sequence runner, and reflex trigger awareness. Sequence execution operational with acknowledgment gating.

- **Version Control Live:**  
  GitHub-backed structure with commit history, dependency pinning, legal license compliance (MIT), and reproducible environment (`requirements.txt`).

## ⚠️ Development Note

This is a **developer-phase release**.  
Modules are under construction, reflex routines are evolving, and underlying logic frameworks are actively being hardened.  
> Use at your own risk. Structural clarity — yes. Runtime guarantees — not yet.

## 👁️ About This Version

This is `v0.3.0-dev` — the *reflex ignition point*.  
The system is not yet production-ready, but its core scaffolding and interaction framework are now complete, deterministic, and extensible.
