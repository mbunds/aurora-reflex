#       • Detects inline <pre><code> copy icon
#       • Detects Monaco line view blocks
#       • Detects full-window Monaco editor SVG icon
#       • Replaces need for mode-specific wait handlers
#       • Some formatting issues remain; code was fleshed-out prematurely
#   - STATUS: Confirmed stable in test_submit_prompt_demo.py
