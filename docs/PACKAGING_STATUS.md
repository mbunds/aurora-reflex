# ⚠️ Not Yet Packaged for External Installation

> Aurora is an active development system and has **not yet been packaged or prepared for distribution** as an installable application.

While the repository is:
- Fully version-controlled
- Legally licensed (MIT)
- Documented with structured project layout and development logs
- Equipped with runtime logic, reflex control, and GUI integration

…it is **not currently equipped** with:
- Install scripts (`setup.py`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.)
- Configured packaging environments (PyInstaller, Docker, etc.)
- Runtime error handling or environment isolation
- Logging, diagnostics, or reproducible test scaffolds
- CLI or GUI harnesses for third-party execution

---

## Developer Use Only (For Now)

This system is intended for:
- Direct use by the primary author
- Experimental development under known environments
- Architecture, reflex behavior, and prompt structure testing

If you are **curious**, feel free to explore the code, read the FLAT files, and examine reflex logic.  
If you are **ambitious**, you're welcome to clone and experiment — but please understand that this is **not yet production-grade software.**

---

> **TL;DR:**  
> Aurora is *versioned and visible*, not *packaged and portable*.  
> Packaging will occur at a future milestone (likely `v0.4.0` or later).
