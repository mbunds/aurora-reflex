## Purpose

This folder defines Aurora’s runtime control bus — the structured signaling channel for starting, stopping, syncing, deploying, resetting, and managing sequence execution across modular reflex layers.

Where `command_bus` handles content-level intent, the control bus governs **execution flow**.

It’s the runtime conductor — the operational spine for “go”, “pause”, and “prepare.”

---

## Responsibilities

- Handle system-wide start, stop, deploy, reset, or pause commands
- Enable GUI and reflex components to issue centralized control signals
- Allow project setup routines, initialization reflexes, or teardown sequences to propagate cleanly
- Coordinate cross-tab or cross-context step execution without tightly coupling module logic
- Facilitate re-arm, cooldown, or reset operations across reflex stacks

---

## Key Files

- `__init__.py`  
  Namespace initializer.

- *(Planned)* `control_bus.py`  
  Will provide a dispatch-ready signal bus for:
    - START, STOP, RESET, RE-ARM
    - Sequence clear or soft abort
    - Reflex cooldown or idle wake triggers

- *(Planned)* `control_dispatcher.py`  
  May support pre-validation or UI sync before dispatching major control signals.

---

## Integration Notes

- Emits signals consumed by:
  - `sequence_controller.py` — to begin or cancel a sequence
  - GUI toolbar or trigger buttons — for system resets or deploy actions
  - Reflex routines — for scoped rearming or global sequence state transitions

- Pairs naturally with:
  - `interrupt_bus/` for emergency overrides
  - `command_bus/` for content-based trigger suggestions

---

## FLAT Compliance

- Tracked in `MAGIC_BUSES.txt`
- All control signals must:
  - Be issued via this bus, not direct function calls
  - Be logged when crossing structural boundaries (e.g., UI → backend)
  - Be clearly documented in FLAT milestones when introducing new signal types

---

## Notes

Reflex is not chaos.  
It follows form — and this is the **command layer** that ensures it does so predictably.

Aurora doesn’t improvise when it comes to execution lifecycle.  
She acts with discipline, and this is the root of that discipline.

Future expansions may include:

- Reflex-aware startup/teardown chains
- Distributed coordination between reflex agents
- Timed rearming sequences and cool-down logic

---

**This isn’t just how Aurora starts.  
This is how she proceeds.**
