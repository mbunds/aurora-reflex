## Purpose

This folder defines Aurora’s diagnostic bus — a reflex-safe internal signaling path dedicated to emitting **runtime health, state visibility, scan results, and execution metadata**.

This is how Aurora *knows* what’s happening as she acts.

It enables structural transparency, performance reflection, and future fault detection mechanisms to emerge naturally from the reflex system.

---

## Responsibilities

- Emit runtime telemetry during step execution or reflex trigger resolution
- Signal error states, failed matches, or timeout events from `reflex_dispatcher.py`
- Report scan results, completion lag, or DOM instability from `session_driver.py`
- Dispatch signals that feed GUI overlays, logging subsystems, or diagnostics collectors
- Maintain future readiness for real-time status visualization and reflex step profiling

---

## Key Files

- `__init__.py`  
  Namespace initializer.

- *(Planned)* `diagnostic_bus.py`  
  Will define the central signal interface for reflex health reporting, trigger match results, and runtime alerts.

- *(Planned)* `diagnostic_reporter.py`  
  May aggregate emitted telemetry into logs or UI-bound status indicators (e.g., performance overlay, step duration meters).

---

## Integration Notes

- Receives input from:
  - `sequence_controller.py` — step duration, loop warnings
  - `reflex_dispatcher.py` — trigger failures, retries, timing notes
  - `session_driver.py` — DOM capture lags, HTML anomalies
- Emits structured status messages, not raw data
- Future: UI tabs may subscribe to diagnostic pings for live overlays

---

## FLAT Compliance

- Registered in `MAGIC_BUSES.txt`
- All modules emitting or consuming this bus must log emitted signal types and expected consumers
- Errors emitted via this bus should also be mirrored in `/logs/` or recorded in milestone summaries when relevant

---

## Notes

Reflex execution is silent by default.  
This bus gives it a voice.

It is not a debugger.  
It is the beginning of **introspective reflex**.

Future expansions may include:

- Live GUI overlays for sequence health
- Reflex step heatmaps or load charts
- Latency-based interrupt triggers or performance warnings

---

**Aurora acts with certainty.  
This is where she senses how well she’s doing it.**
