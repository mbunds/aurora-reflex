Module: core/control/simulated_dispatcher.py
Authors: ChatGPT and Mark
Created: 2025-04-20
Location: Evans, Colorado
Project: Aurora

Simulated dispatcher module that replaces browser interaction with GUI-driven
manual prompt/response exchange. Used for development, testing, and verification
of sequence behavior without launching an actual ChatGPT session.

Simulated Reflex Dispatcher

Provides prompt injection and wait emulation without launching a browser.
Prompts appear in the PromptSimulatorWindow; replies are entered manually.
