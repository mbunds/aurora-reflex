Module: core/watchdog/timeout_recovery.py
Authors: ChatGPT and Mark
Created: 2025-04-25
Location: Evans, Colorado
Project: Aurora

This module defines structured recovery routines invoked when
the watchdog timer triggers due to session timeout, step failure,
or missing reflex completion. Recovery strategies include retries,
sequence aborts, or diagnostic escalation based on reflex context.
