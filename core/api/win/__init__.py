It is loaded dynamically at runtime by core.api.__init__.py based on host OS.
Windows-specific functions for file handling, application launching,
or system diagnostics should be implemented here.

DEV NOTES (Windows Edition):

When parsing something like:

    /LAUNCH APP: notepad.exe/
    /OPEN FOLDER: C:/Users/Mark/Desktop/
    /CODE COMPLETE/

…your dispatcher might extract:

    if token == "/LAUNCH APP/":
        result = launch_app(arg)
    elif token == "/OPEN FOLDER/":
        result = open_folder(arg)
