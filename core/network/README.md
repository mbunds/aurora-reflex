## Purpose

This folder is reserved for Aurora’s future network interaction layer. It will house modules that allow the system to interact with remote services, issue outbound commands, synchronize data with cloud resources, or communicate with peer reflex agents across distributed systems.

This is where **external reflex** begins.

## Responsibilities

- Serve as an architectural boundary for non-local execution contexts
- Handle outbound reflex events (e.g., remote prompt dispatch, HTTP-triggered sequence execution)
- Manage authentication, access control, and trusted endpoint logic
- Provide support for remote file operations, RPC calls, or peer-to-peer reflex messaging
- Integrate with project-aware or reflex-scoped network communication logic

## Key Files

- `__init__.py`  
  Present to reserve the namespace and enforce import compatibility. No modules committed yet.

- *(Planned)* `remote_dispatcher.py`  
  Will issue outbound reflex actions to remote systems or services and handle asynchronous completion acknowledgment.

- *(Planned)* `peer_sync.py`  
  Intended to support reflex-state sharing between Aurora nodes (if distributed agent behavior emerges).

- *(Planned)* `heartbeat_monitor.py`  
  May track connectivity status for network-reflex-linked nodes or endpoints.

## Integration Notes

- This folder is currently inert — no active modules exist yet
- `core/control/` and `core/project/` will eventually interface with this layer once distributed or remote goal contexts emerge
- Reflex sequencing logic may be extended to issue commands to remote agents or cloud-based reflex systems

---

## FLAT Compliance

- Folder is referenced in `T01_OVERVIEW.txt` as a placeholder for future architectural expansion
- All outbound behaviors must be logged and scoped in FLAT files (e.g., `T03_NETWORK_EXPANSION.txt`, if such a trunk is created)
- External reflexes triggered via this system must return interpretable states for Aurora’s local sequence controller

---

## Notes

Aurora is currently local.  
But structure, once encoded, is transferable.

This folder exists because reflex logic should not stop at the machine boundary.  
It may one day reach into external systems, agents, or ambient infrastructure.

Future directions may include:

- Network-prompted project initialization
- Multi-node sequence collaboration
- Remote reflex acknowledgment chains

**Aurora does not yet reach outward.  
But this is where she could begin to.**
