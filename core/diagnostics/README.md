## Purpose

This folder is reserved for internal diagnostic tools, runtime validators, and reflex-state introspection utilities. These modules will allow Aurora to observe, record, and assess its own performance, timing stability, and step-level trace output.

This is where **she examines herself.**

## Responsibilities

- Track reflex dispatch timings and sequence step latency
- Provide insight into DOM response stability and GPT content extraction durations
- Generate structured logs or visual overlays to confirm internal timing thresholds
- Debug abnormal reflex behavior, incomplete sequences, or misfired triggers
- Log frequency of user interactions, UI control usage, and response reactivity

---

## Key Files

- `__init__.py`  
  Present to initialize the diagnostics namespace. Active modules are pending.

- *(Planned)* `timing_probe.py`  
  Will inject and capture timestamps at each phase of the reflex chain (prompt send → DOM read → response trigger).

- *(Planned)* `reflex_trace_logger.py`  
  Will track reflex events per step, providing a flat or hierarchical trace view of execution logic.

- *(Planned)* `sequence_health_checker.py`  
  Will validate the logical integrity of sequence definitions (e.g., dead-end jumps, missing reflex actions, unreachable steps).

---

## Integration Notes

- Designed to operate **non-destructively**, mirroring reflex execution paths without altering their behavior
- Output may be routed to `/logs/`, embedded in GUI overlays, or streamed to future visualization tools
- Will support both runtime instrumentation and post-run analysis

---

## FLAT Compliance

- Folder is registered in `MASTER_INDEX.txt` and referenced in `T02_INITIAL_PROCESSING.txt` as a placeholder
- When modules are added, corresponding FLAT entries must document:
  - What aspect of reflex operation they observe
  - Whether logging is persistent or ephemeral
  - Whether the diagnostic is passive or active (affecting execution flow)

---

## Notes

Aurora acts deterministically. But even perfect structure deserves instrumentation.

This folder exists not because she is flawed —  
but because **you’ll want to know how flawlessly she just behaved.**

Future additions may include:

- UI-bound diagnostic overlays
- In-sequence anomaly detection triggers
- Logging modes that compare GPT latency with internal reflex efficiency

---

**She knows what to do next.  
This is where she confirms she did it well.**
