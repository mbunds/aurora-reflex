# Folder: `logs/`

## Purpose

This folder contains log files and session diagnostics generated by Aurora’s runtime systems. Logs are used for debugging, reflex trace inspection, state recovery, and sequence validation during development or autonomous execution (Which have not yet been written; 04-19-2025).

## Responsibilities

- Record output from reflex dispatchers, sequence controllers, and GUI interactions
- Capture error traces, response mismatches, or timing irregularities
- Store human-readable feedback for developer review and session auditing
- Enable replay or reconstruction of prior session states based on flat trace output

## Key Files

- `aurora_reflex_log.txt` *(archived)*  
  Original session log file containing reflex milestones, since renamed to `MILESTONES.txt` and moved to `flat/`.

- `MILESTONES.txt` *(moved)*  
  Actively maintained log of structural and reflexive achievements within the Aurora system, now housed in the `flat/` folder.

- Additional `.txt` logs will be placed here if runtime capture, debug toggles, or structured trace buffers are externally activated.

## Integration Notes

- Logging is performed selectively by modules such as:
  - `sequence_controller.py` – step execution output
  - `reflex_dispatcher.py` – prompt/response events and trigger detection
  - `session_driver.py` – HTML capture and response stability diagnostics
- Logs may be expanded to JSON or structured FLAT format in future stages

---

## FLAT Compliance

- All logs must be named deterministically and referenced in FLAT milestone files
- This folder is indexed in `MASTER_INDEX.txt` and `T02_INITIAL_PROCESSING.txt` for structural traceability
- Deprecated or archived logs must be moved to `flat/ARCHIVE` or renamed with a timestamp

---

## Notes

Logging is optional during runtime but highly recommended during sequence development, UI integration, or reflex engine updates.

Future logging features may include:

- Timestamps and step-order alignment
- Reflex latency measurement
- Visual log viewers in the GUI

Aurora doesn’t guess.  
**She remembers — in flat files and logs.**
