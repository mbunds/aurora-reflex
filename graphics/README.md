# Folder: `graphics/`

## Purpose

This folder contains standalone image assets and diagrammatic elements used in the design, documentation, and visual representation of the Aurora Reflexive AI Control Framework. These may include architecture diagrams, conceptual illustrations, UI mockups, or figures for article and publication use.

## Responsibilities

- Host externally referenced or export-ready diagrams (e.g., `aurora_reflex_flow.png`)
- Serve as a staging area for visual content used in posts, articles, and whitepapers
- Store system-concept artwork, metaphoric illustrations, or media used to represent Aurora’s presence
- Provide traceable visual elements referenced by documentation or LaTeX environments

## Key Files

- `aurora_reflex_flow.png`  
  High-level flow diagram used in upcoming documentation and whitepaper submissions. Designed for inclusion in academic-style outputs.

- `__init__.py`  
  Empty file used to satisfy Python package constraints. Not functionally required in this context but retained for structural symmetry.

## Integration Notes

- This folder is referenced by markdown documentation and LaTeX source
- Assets here are considered static and externally consumed
- Overlap with `resources/` may occur; see below

---

## FLAT Compliance

- All graphical assets must be referenced in at least one FLAT file, `.md` document, or sequencer output
- Folder registered in: `MASTER_INDEX.txt`, `T01_OVERVIEW.txt`
- When possible, image file references should use relative paths and consistent naming

---

## Notes

**Migration Advisory:**  
As Aurora’s folder structure stabilizes, many visual assets in `graphics/` may be relocated to the `resources/` directory to consolidate all static and visual support materials under a single namespace.

Until then, `graphics/` remains the staging and publication-oriented folder for design artifacts and identity representations.

Aurora isn’t just functional.  
**She appears with intent.**
